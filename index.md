#Hi, I’m Adam.

I’m a designer and front-end developer living in Chicago. I value simplicity, honest feedback, and collaboration. Currently, I work on the design team at [8th Light](http://8thlight.com/design-studio/), helping clients big and small build beautiful web products.

In my spare time, I enjoy [learning](/blog), [teaching](/css-workshop), and [contributing](/grid). You can follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/helloadamkaplan), [GitHub](https://github.com/aekaplan), [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/adamkaplan) and [Instagram](http://instagram.com/adamekaplan).
