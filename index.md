##My name is Adam and I’m a designer living in Chicago.

I built my own open-source [responsive framework]({{ site.url }}/grid) that optimizes websites for usability on all devices—from mobile phones to large screens.

After graduating from Columbia College in 2004 with a Bachelor of Arts in film editing, I worked for several years as a film editor and production assistant before accepting a UX apprenticeship at 8th Light.

At [8th Light](http://www.8thlight.com), I learned to keep things simple under the direction of [Stephanie Briones](http://www.stephaniebriones.com). I studied color theory, typography and usability. I studied web and interaction design where I honed my front-end skills and gained experience working in numerous web frameworks. I have had the opportunity to work on numerous projects leading design and implementation of web application front-end.

I love teaching others and have created and hosted several workshops including a three-part [CSS Workshop](http://www.adamkaplan.me/css-workshop) that taught people how to write better CSS. At times, I [write](/blog) about design and front-end development.
