  <h2>Born and raised in Chicago, Adam grew up with a love for creating things.</h2>

  <p>Before designing, he studied film at Columbia College and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts. He was a video editor for many years before discovering <a href='http://www.8thlight.com/' target="_blank">8th Light</a>.</p>

  <p>Adam studied design under <a href="http://www.8thlight.com/our-team/stephanie-briones" target="_blank">Stephanie Briones</a>, where he learned to keep things simple. Adam believes that good design should not only be beautiful but also easy to use.</p>

  <p>When he is not designing you will find him running, playing video games, and going out to dinner with his friends.</p>
