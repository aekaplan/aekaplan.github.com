###Description
In this [three part workshop](http://www.adamkaplan.me/css-workshop), [Stephanie Briones](http://www.stephaniebriones.com) and I taught how to write better CSS using best practices. We covered organization, writing reusable CSS and advanced techniques.

I also had the opportunity to do this workshop for the [NCSA](http://www.ncsasports.org) front-end developers. The [syllabus](https://github.com/aekaplan/css-workshop) is available on GitHub.

###Web
The website was built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and Sass. I created a simple navigation for each day of the workshop. Code examples have a copy to clipboard button for easy copying. Headers have anchors for easily sharing specific sections.

Like all my projects, I built this mobile first. Read my guide to [responsive design](http://www.adamkaplan.me/grid) to learn more.
