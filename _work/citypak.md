###Web
The website was built with Rails and includes a custom CMS.

{% include browser.html image="citypak/citypak-desktop" %}
{% include browser.html image="citypak/citypak-about-desktop" %}
{% include browser.html image="citypak/citypak-branding-desktop" %}

###Admin
The custom admin uses Google authentication for login. Images use drag and drop for posts and gallery creation.

{% include browser.html image="citypak/citypak-admin-posts" %}
{% include browser.html image="citypak/citypak-admin-gallery" %}

###Mobile
In order to save space on mobile, I built a simple toggle that hides and shows the navigation.

{% include browser.html mobile=true image="citypak/citypak-home-mobile" %}
{% include browser.html mobile=true image="citypak/citypak-navigation-mobile" %}
