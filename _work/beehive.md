###Description
This project was a fun experiment with home automation. It intergrates with [Z-wave](http://www.z-wave.com) to control my lights anywhere in my house.

###Logo
The beehive represents my house while the honeycomb serves as a great interconnected metaphor. The primary color is a "honey" orange.

###Web
This application was built was Sintra and Sass. I built an iOS toggle with pure CSS for turning on and off the lights. CSS animations make the experience fun.
