###Description
This project was a fun experiment with home automation. It intergrates with [Z-wave](http://www.z-wave.com) to control my lights anywhere in my house.

###Logo
The beehive represents my house while the honeycomb serves as a great interconnected metaphor. The primary color is a "honey" orange.

###Web
This application was built was Sintra and Sass. I built an iOS toggle with pure CSS for turning on and off the lights. CSS animations make the experience fun.

<div class="chrome">
  <div class="chrome__header">
    <ul class="spotlights">
      <li class="spotlights__item"></li>
      <li class="spotlights__item"></li>
      <li class="spotlights__item"></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="chrome__inner">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/work/beehive/beehive-desktop.png">
  </div>
</div>

###Mobile
This application was built mobile first for use on my phone.

<div class="chrome chrome--mobile">
  <div class="chrome__header">
    <ul class="spotlights">
      <li class="spotlights__item"></li>
      <li class="spotlights__item"></li>
      <li class="spotlights__item"></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="chrome__inner">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/work/beehive/beehive-mobile.png">

</div>
