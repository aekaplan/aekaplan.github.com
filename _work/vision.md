###Description
Vision is an internal application I built for [8th Light](http://www.8thlight.com). 8th Light employees can read updates from management, access other internal applications and edit their profile.

This application was built with Rails and Sass.

{% include browser.html image="vision/vision-desktop" %}

{% include browser.html image="vision/vision-navigation-desktop" %}

###Mobile
