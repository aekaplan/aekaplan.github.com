###Description
[Grid](http://www.adamkaplan.me/grid) was a personal project I created to help teach responsive design to my co-workers. The feedback from the community was amazing and I wrote a [retrospective]({{ site.url }}/blog/grid-retrospective) on what I learned a year later. It's even been translated into five different languages.

###Logo
![Responsive]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/work/grid/grid-logo.svg)

###Web
The website was built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and plain CSS. It wanted the code to be accessible to beginners so I stayed away from Sass. [View the code](https://github.com/aekaplan/grid) on GitHub.

<div class="chrome">
  <div class="chrome__header">
    <ul class="spotlights">
      <li class="spotlights__item"></li>
      <li class="spotlights__item"></li>
      <li class="spotlights__item"></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="chrome__inner">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/work/grid/grid-desktop.png">
  </div>
</div>

###Mobile
This project uses a simple mobile first approach.

<div class="chrome chrome--mobile">
  <div class="chrome__header">
    <ul class="spotlights">
      <li class="spotlights__item"></li>
      <li class="spotlights__item"></li>
      <li class="spotlights__item"></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="chrome__inner">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/work/grid/grid-mobile.png">
  </div>
</div>
