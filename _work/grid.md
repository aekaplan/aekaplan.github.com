###Description
[Grid](http://www.adamkaplan.me/grid) was a personal project I created to help teach responsive design to my co-workers. The feedback from the community was amazing and I wrote a [retrospective](/blog/grid-retrospective) on what I learned a year later. It's even been translated into five different languages.

###Web
The website was built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and plain CSS. I wanted the code to be accessible to beginners so I stayed away from Sass. [View the code](https://github.com/aekaplan/grid) on GitHub. Simple illustrations help visual harder concepts.
