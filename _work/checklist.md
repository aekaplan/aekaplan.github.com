###Description
I built this [checklist](http://apprenticeship-checklist.herokuapp.com/) during my apperenticeship at [8th Light](http://www.8thlight.com) to help keep track of my progress and assignments. It's now used internally to help apprentices.

###Web
The website was built with Middleman and stores your data locally in the browser. The sidebar stays fixed as you scroll. The progress bar updates as each task is checked with simple javascript/CSS animations.
