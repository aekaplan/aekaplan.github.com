<h1>Thinking with Type</h1>

<p>I just finished reading <a href='http://www.thinkingwithtype.com/' target='blank'>Thinking with Type</a> by Ellen Lupton. There are a lot of great concepts in this book, so I decided to create a few designs using typography to show off my favorites.</p>

<h2>Think more, design less.</h2>

<p>Some type crimes to be aware of:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Horizontal and vertical scaling</li>
	<li>Vertically stacking lowercase</li>
	<li>Using too many signals (bold, italic, underlined, caps)</li>
	<li>Don't trap data in heavily guarded cells</li>
</ul>
