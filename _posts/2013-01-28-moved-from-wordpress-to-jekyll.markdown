title: Moved from Wordpress to Jekyll
date: January 29, 2013

##I accomplished my goal of leaving Wordpress today!

It was a hard challenge but my blog is now powered by <a href='http://jekyllrb.com/' target='blank'>Jekyll</a> and hosted on <a href='http://github.com/' target='blank'>Github</a>.

So why Jekyll?

* No heavy CMS, database or FTP to deal with.
* Hosting is free using Github pages!
* I now get version control and deployment in one place.
* Direct control over my markup. No more rich-text editor for writing posts.
* Super fast! I went from 5 s to 300 ms improving load times by 94%.

This site is under construction! I'm learning new skills so I can make this blog awesome. Check back soon.
