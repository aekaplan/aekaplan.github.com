title: Moved from Wordpress to Jekyll
date: January 29, 2013

<h2>I accomplished my goal of leaving Wordpress today! It was a hard challenge but my blog is now powered by <a href='http://jekyllrb.com/' target='blank'>Jekyll</a> and hosted on <a href='http://github.com/' target='blank'>Github</a>.</h2>

<h3>Why Jekyll?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>No heavy CMS, database or FTP to deal with.</li>
	<li>Hosting is free using Github pages!</li>
	<li>I now get version control and deployment in one place.</li>
	<li>Direct control over my markup. No more rich-text editor for writing posts.</li>
	<li>Super fast! I went from 5 s to 300 ms improving load times by 94%.</li>
</ul>

<p>This site is under construction! I'm learning new skills so I can make this blog awesome. Check back soon.</p>
