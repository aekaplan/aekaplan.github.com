title: Optimize your Images
date: February 1, 2013
---

<h2>When using images on the web, always remove unnecessary bytes. The smaller the image the faster the load!</h2>

<p>Here are a few simple guidelines when using Photoshop:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Always use the <strong>Save for Web</strong> option</li>
	<li>Try to find a balance between <strong>image quality</strong> and <strong>file size</strong></li>
	<li>Use <strong>High</strong> if the image will be visible, <strong>Medium</strong> or <strong>Low</strong> for backgrounds</li>
	<li>Make sure you have the <strong>Optimized</strong> setting checked</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Test different file types and optimizations methods</li>
	<li>Use JPGs for photos and PNGs when you need transparency</li>
	<li>Use appropriately sized photos when possible</li>
</ul>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>Stephanie noticed that a background image I was using was taking a long time to load. By following these simple guidelines, my image went from 2mb to 80kb! That's a huge reduction in size. Thanks Stephanie. </p>
