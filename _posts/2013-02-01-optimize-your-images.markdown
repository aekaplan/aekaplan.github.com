title: Optimize your Images
date: February 1, 2013
---

When using images on the web, always remove unnecessary bytes.

Here are a few simple guidelines when using Photoshop:

* Always use the **Save for Web** option
* Try to find a balance between **image quality** and **file size**
* Use **High** if the image will be visible, **Medium** or **Low** for backgrounds
* Make sure you have the **Optimized** setting checked

![Save for Web]({{ site.url }}/images/optimize.jpg)

* Test different file types and optimizations methods
* Use JPGs for photos and PNGs when you need transparency
* Use appropriately sized photos when possible

###Results

Stephanie noticed that one of the images on my website was loading slow. By
following these simple guidelines, my image went from 2mb to 80kb!
That's a huge reduction in size. Thanks Stephanie!
