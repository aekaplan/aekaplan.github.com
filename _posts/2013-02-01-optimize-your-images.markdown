title: Optimize your images
date: February 1, 2013
---

<h2>When using images for the web, the goal should be to remove unnecessary bytes from your images. The smaller the better. It's important to test out different file types and optimizations methods. </h2>

<p>Here are a few simple guidelines in Photoshop:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Always use the Save for Web option</li>
	<li>Try to find a balance between image quality and file size</li>
	<li>Use High if the image will be visible, Medium or Low for backgrounds</li>
	<li>Make sure you have the Optimized setting checked</li>
	<li>Use JPGs for photos and PNGs when you need transparency</li>
	<li>Use appropriately sized photos when possible</li>
</ul>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>Stephanie noticed that a background image I was using was taking a long time to load. By following these guidelines, my image went from 2mb to just 80kb! That's a huge reduction in size. Try these out!</p>
