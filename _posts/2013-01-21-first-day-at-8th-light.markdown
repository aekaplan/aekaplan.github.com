title: First Day at 8th Light
date: January 21, 2013

##Hi there! Today was the first day of my Novice Apprenticeship at [8th Light](http://www.8thlight.com).

I started my morning with a design standup with Stephanie and Chris. We talked about what it means to work on a story.
Everyone plays a small part in helping to shape and complete a project at 8th Light. All this collaboration will go a long way in helping me refine my design process.

A few things I learned today:

* Collaboration is key when coming up with a successful design.
* Whole experiences can be harmonious and have a purpose just by starting with type.
* Try to find some inspiration, natural references when starting a design. What's the hook? Type can be that hook!
* Always provide solutions when communicating with a client.

Stay tuned for a post on working with typography!
