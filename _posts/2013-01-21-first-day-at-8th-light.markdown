<h1>First Day at 8th Light</h1>

<h2>Hi there! Today was the first day of my Novice Apprenticeship at 8th Light.</h2>

<p>I started my morning with a design standup with Stephanie and Chris. We talked about what it means to work on a story. Everyone plays a small part in helping to shape and complete a project at 8th Light. All this collaboration will go a long way in helping me refine my design process.</p>

<p>A few things I learned today:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Collaboration is key when coming up with a successful design.</li>
	<li>Whole experiences can be harmonious and have a purpose just by starting with type.</li>
	<li>Try to find some inspiration, natural references when starting a design. What's the hook? Type can be that hook!</li>
	<li>Always provide solutions when communicating with a client.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stay tuned for a post on working with typography!</p>
