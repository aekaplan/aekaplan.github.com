##SCNA is a conference for software professionals interested in improving their craft, their community, and themselves.

I had the opportinity to design and build this year's <a href="http://scna.softwarecraftsmanship.com/" target="_blank">SCNA website</a>. I'm really excited to share some of the work I did with Alejandra on this project!
