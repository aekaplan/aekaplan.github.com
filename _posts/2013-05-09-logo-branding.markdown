<h2>A logo can embody a unique identity that can help promote you and your brand by making it easily recognizable.</h2>

<p>What, exactly, is a logo?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A logo is a graphic mark or emblem commonly used by commercial enterprises, organizations and even individuals to aid and promote instant public recognition.

<p>
Logos can come in many forms. Some are purely graphic (symbols/icons), while others are typographic (a logotype or word mark).

<h3>My Assignment</h3>
<p>
My assignment for the week was to do some personal branding and spruce up my blog. To start, I added a navigation to split up my blog and project pages and added a new biography that uses CSS animations (mostly for fun!).
</p>

<p>
I realized I needed a logo to replace my existing "AK" initials. This post will cover some of the experiences and lessons I learned along the way!
</p>

<h3>Plan (Grow Your Ideas)</h3>
<p>
It is really important to think through your ideas before you even pick up a piece of paper or open your laptop. After you've had time to think through and mature your idea, start sketching and playing with it a bit. Let this be the time to really think outside of the box! Use a piece of paper or a whiteboard to quickly get your ideas out. Only move to Illustrator once you're ready to refine your idea and create a more finished logo.

<p>
Lately, I have been spending a little more time in the planning stage and I've found that my work is better for it. I had a simple idea for my logo, but I let the idea mature for awhile before I created anything.
</p>

<p>
The concept for my logo was simple; replace my initials "AK" with something less typographical. I still wanted it to be about my name, so I started with shapes that mimic a slanted "A" and "K".
</p>

<p>
I wanted something unique that would represent my personality, a mark that could grow with me over time and help identify me as a designer. Before going further, I got feedback from the other designers. With comments like it kinda looks like a wave or paper airplane. I liked the fact that it was a little open to interpretation.

<h3>Experiment with Color</h3>
<p>
For my logo, the silhouette was extremely important. I tried some colors, including the red from my blog and a shade of blue I really liked. In the end, I went with the gray because I felt it made the header less obtrusive. I wanted it to be part of the page, not overpowering it.

<h3>Size Matters</h3>
<p>
It's important to consider how scalable your logo is. Ask yourself how well will hold up on mobile, or on a giant billboard. Lots of detail can get lost as the pixels shrink and your logo can become unrecognizable. 
</p>

<p>
I did some quick testing and the logo I went with was easily recognizable on mobile devices, where space is at a premium. Because I was able to scale it down, I gave myself room to add more navigation items to my blog if needed.
</p>

<h3>Take Risks</h3>
<p>
Lastly, don't be afraid to take some risks! You need to stand out among the crowd and a unique logo can help immensely. Logo design is new to me, so it was a fun and very rewarding experience, but I still have a lot to learn. I'm really happy with how my logo turned out, but I plan on iterating on it more in the future.
