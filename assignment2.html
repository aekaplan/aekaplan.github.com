		<p class='magazine'><span class='first'>The Metaphor of</span> technical debt in software development was introduced two decades ago by Ward Cunningham<sup>1</sup> to explain to nontechnical product stakeholders the need for what we call now &ldquo;refactoring.&rdquo; It has been refined and expanded since, notably by Steve McConnell in his taxonomy,<sup>2</sup> Martin Fowler with his four quadrants,<sup>3</sup> and Jim Highsmith and his colleagues from the Cutter Consortium with their model of the impact of technical debt on the total cost of ownership.<sup>4</sup></p>

		<p class='magazine'>From the original description&mdash;&ldquo;not quite right code which we postpone making it right&rdquo; <sup>1</sup>&mdash;various people have used the metaphor of technical &ldquo;debt&rdquo; to describe many other kinds of debts of ills of software development, encompassing broadly anything that stands in the way of deploying, selling, or evolving a software system or anything that adds to the friction from which software development endeavors suffer: test, debt, people debt, architectural debt, requirement debt, documentation debt, or just an amorphous, all-encompassing software debt.<sup>5</sup></p>

	<div class="col">
		<p class='magazine'>Consequently, the concept of technical debt in software development has become somewhat diluted lately. Is a new requirement, function, or feature not yet implemented &ldquo;requirement debt&rdquo;? Do we call postponing the development of a new function &ldquo;planning debt&rdquo;? The metaphor is losing some of it's strength.</p>
				
		<p class='magazine'>Furthermore, once we identify tools such as static code analyzers to assist us in identifying technical debt, there&rsquo;s a danger of equating it with whatever our tools can detect. This approach leads to leaving aside large amounts of potential technical debt that&rsquo;s undetectable by tools such as structural or architectural debt or technological gaps. Gaps in technology are of particular interest because the debt incurred.</p>
