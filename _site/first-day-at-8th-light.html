	<h1>First Day at 8th Light</h1>
		<h2>Hi there! Today was the first day of my Novice Apprenticeship at <a href='http://www.8thlight.com/' target='blank'>8th Light</a>.</h2>




<p>I started my morning with a design standup with Stephanie and Chris. We talked about what it means to work on a story. Everyone plays a small part in helping to shape and complete a project at 8th Light. All this collaboration will go a long way in helping me refine my design process.</p>




<p>A few things I learned today:</p>




<ul>
    <li>Collaboration is key when coming up with a successful design.</li>
    <li>Whole experiences can be harmonious and have a purpose just by starting with type.</li>
    <li>Try to find some inspiration, natural references when starting a design. What's the hook? Type can be that hook!</li>
    <li>Always provide solutions when communicating with a client.</li>
</ul>




<p>Stay tuned for a post on working with typography!</p>
