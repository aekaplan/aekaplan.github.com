  <h2>Hi there! Today was the first day of my Novice Apprenticeship at 8th Light.</h2>

<p>I started my morning with a design standup with Stephanie and Chris. We talked about what it means to work on a story. Everyone plays a small part in helping to shape and complete a project at 8th Light. All this collaboration will go a long way in helping me refine my design process.</p>
