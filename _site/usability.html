      <h1>Why Usability Matters</h1>
      <h2>Usability testing can be one of the best ways to make your website easier to use.</h2>
      <p>
        This article is going to focus on my reading of <a href="http://www.sensible.com/rsme.html" target="_blank">Rocket Surgery Made Easy</a> by Steve Krug and the ChiScore application that I built here at 8th light.
      </p>

      <p>
        So what is usability testing?
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
           Watching people try to use what your creating, with the intention of (a) making it easier to use or (b) proving that it is easy to use.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        There are two different types of testing available each with own implications:
      </p>

      <div class="row cf">
        <div class='column half'>
          <h3>Qualitative</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Deals with descriptions</li>
            <li>"Do it yourself"</li>
            <li>Gain insight through context</li>
            <li>Capture emotion</li>
        </ul>
        </div>

        <div class='column half'>
          <h3>Quantitative</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Deals with numbers</li>
            <li>Requires larger sample size</li>
            <li>Data/fact driven</li>
            <li>Prove something</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div><!--row-->

        <p>
          I'm more interested in gaining insight through qualitative research so I can improve what I'm building and less on statistics. The whole idea behind <a href="http://www.sensible.com/rsme.html" target="_blank">Rocket Surgery Made Easy</a> is that you can do qualitative testing yourself or with a few people.
        </p>

        <h3>ChiScore</h3>

        <p>
          I recently had the opportunity to work on an application with Brian Pratt and Rylan Dirksen. It's called ChiScore and was built to check-in teams for the <a href="http://www.chiditarod.org/" target="_blank">Chiditarod</a>.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
         <p>
           Chiditarod (think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iditarod_Trail_Sled_Dog_Race" target="_blank">Iditarod</a>) is Chicago's Epic Urban Iditarod. A charity food drive, beauty pageant, costumed shopping cart race, talent show, fundraiser and chaos generator all in one. And probably the world's largest mobile food drive, benefitting the <a href="http://www.chicagosfoodbank.org/site/PageServer" target="_blank">Greater Chicago Food Depository</a>.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        My role in this  project was to design and implement the front end. I decided to challenge myself by making the application responsive too!
      </p>

      <p>
      Brian wanted ChiScore to be clean and simple. I started with some sketches before picking my fonts and colors. These days, I do most of my desigining in browser. Check out <a href="http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/the-post-psd-era/">The Post PSD Era</a> by Brad Frost. I rarely do mockups in Photoshop or Illustrator anymore.
      </p>
     
      <p>
        Here is what I came up with:
      </p>
      <img src="images/checkin3-desktop.jpg" alt="Desktop Checkin" />

      <p>
        I didn't realize it at the time, but I was going to get my first opportunity to do some qualitative usability testing.
      </p>

      <h3>ChiScore Usability Testing</h3>
      <p>
        We finally had a working protype (with responsive elements) and it was time to show it off to the Chiditarod team for feedback. This was such a rewarding experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        Brian presented to a room of over 40 voluteeers along with the oraganizer. I went around the room and helped the voluteeers load up ChiScore in their browsers. At that moment, I realized I just gain a room full of test participants. 
      </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
          In usability testing, we call the people we're observing "test participants," not "test subjects," to remind ourselves that we really aren't testing them &mdash; we're testing the thing they're using.
        </p>
